# Face-Tracking-On-The-Live-Streaming
Face Tracking On The Live Streaming is used to detect a human face using haar cascade algorithms. Haar cascade algorithms are used to detect face on video from give set of image . Based on ads-boot learning methods. Train modules has 2 aspect as negative and positive image. positive image are These images contain the images which we want our classifier to identify. Negative Images are Images of everything else, which do not contain the object we want to detect. Detects Modules are Detects the face from the live streaming video with the accuracy score. Classifier detects the features on the human face which is stored as a object in the machine learning algorithm.

Front end - Python Tkinter.

Back end  - python Programming.

Data base - excel File(.csv)
